A singer named Tansen had the most beautiful  voice in Kingdom and wanted to suck her boobs.  So he asked his close friend and King's  minister Birbal to help him out. 

Tansen: I want to suck queen's  boobs please  help me Birbal. 

Birbal: What will I get if I help you?

Birbal: The only way to solve this is if a person with beautiful voice suck them.

75,"A young man is in need of a job,"," And he looks through the classifieds to see what's available. He finds an ad from a farmer in need of some extra hands, so the man calls up the farmer and agrees to meet the next day to see what work he'd be doing.

The farmer greets him at the gate and begins to show the young man around. First, they come across a mango grove, and the farmer explains that he'll be picking and packaging the mangoes for sale. Then they go into the farmhouse, and the farmer introduces the young man to his daughter, Annie, and explains that during the heat of the day, the young man is to help Annie with all of her chores. The young man nods, and they move on. Lastly, they stop at a chicken coop, and the farmer proudly showcases his prize chickens, and his award winner who he named Thai, for the basil she ate that the farmer swore made her plumage glossy.

The young man begins work, and notices how little the farmer is around. So, he figures, he might as well line his pockets by taking a few mangoes for himself and selling them directly. It works out quite well for him, but the excitement of thievery wears off after a while, so he has to find something new to occupy himself with.

During the middle of the day, when he worked inside with Annie, the young man would sweep, so he could sneak peeks at her cleavage whenever she bent over with the dustpan. Again, the farmer didn't seem to notice, and the young man went about his day.

Eventually, he gets bored of Annie, and the mango sales have left him with quite a bit of money. So he figures that the next day he'll steal the farmer's prize chicken and get the hell out of dodge.

He's got the chicken in his hands, and is opening the gate to get off the farm when the farmer suddenly appears and shoots him in the foot. The young man released the bird and starts howling and hollering about how batshit crazy the farmer must be.

The farmer gathers up the chicken, still aiming the rifle at the young man and says:

""I didn't mind ya taking my mangas, and I done ignored you watchin' my Annie May, but if you think you can just blast off with my hen, Thai, you gotta 'nother thing comin'!""",Jokes,1577817764,chewablepebbles,4,1,True,2019-12-31

The bad news is that it will require castration""","The doctor said, ""You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.""

Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.

WeWhen he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store &amp; thought, ""That's what I need - a new suit.""

He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see ... size 44 long."" Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Been in the business 60 years!"" Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly.

As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure."" The salesman eyed Joe and said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve &amp; 16-1/2 neck."" Again, Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Been in the business 60 years!""

Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"" Joe was on a roll and said, ""Sure."" The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see ... 9-1/2 E."" Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Been in the business 60 years!""

Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure."" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see... size 36.""

Joe laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 underwear would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.",Jokes,1577822713,fekumama,1,1,True,2019-12-31

238,Chicken in a Library,"A young librarian is amazed during her first day at work to see a chicken stride into the Library with an armful of books. The chicken walks up to him and deposits the books on the desk. Apart from a little pong weed on one of the covers, they are all within the lending period, in fact, they had only been issued the previous day.

The chicken walks in amongst the shelves muttering quietly:
	“Book, book, book”.

The young librarian turns to one of her colleagues and asks about the chicken.
	“Oh, yes” the colleague replies,” she comes in every day, collects a wing full of books, takes them away and brings them back the next day.”

Anyway, this continues for several weeks until the young librarian can stand it no longer and he resolves to follow the bird home and see what happens. The chicken turns up at her dual time, collects her wing full of books and heads put of the Library. The young librarian follows at a discrete distance.

I won’t bore you with the details of the chickens devious route home, suffice it to say she definitely didn’t want to be followed. Fortunately, the young librarian had managed to hang on and watched from behind a bush, as the chicken (taking a good look around to make sure nobody was about) nipped into a forest of tall reeds beside a duck pond.

He crept quietly into the reed only to be confronted by the sight of the chicken handling the books to a frog:

He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”",Jokes,1577842674,MrTutiFruti,0,1,True,2019-12-31

428,I made a (hopefully) original joke!,"In 2019, the army had been at war with another country. In order to keep their troops healthy, they needed to monitor the submarine that carried supplies to where the others were located.

But there was a small problem. Every so often, there would be a defect in the submarine's engine that would cause it to shut down. These defects were manageable at first, but they slowly became so severe that the crew had no choice but to get several ships to surround the submarine and make sure it was functioning properly.

Each ship had a small selection of sailors posted on the end of the ship, and their jobs were to watch the submarine for any problems. If they found any, they were to report to the aiding crew that would repair the ship's engine and keep it alive.

But there was a problem. Despite sailors being required to sit around and do nothing all day, they were hardly being paid. And this inspired a strike! The sailors eventually all abandoned their posts, meaning there was nobody watching over the submarine.

The military leader was confused by the complaints he was hearing and decided to investigate for himself. He went on the security cameras and went to ship 1, but nobody was there.

He checked ship 2, and nobody was there.

He checked ship 3, and nobody was there!

Panicking, the leader called the ship's aiding crew and screamed ""Is this sub still active?! I haven't seen any posts since last deck, Aid!""",Jokes,1577855860,ThatOtherDude1817,2,1,True,2020-01-01

Suddenly the first priests fishing rod bends alarmingly; he has hooked a huge fish! It's a struggle but he managed to reel it in. It's a beautiful rainbow coloured fish and big enough to feed a family. 

""Would you look at the size of that *Fucker*!"" he exclaims, startling the second priest. 

""Hey, you can't talk like that; you're a man of the cloth. I'm a man of the cloth!"" Says the second priest, scandalised. 

The first priest raises his hands in a calming gesture ""It's ok my good fellow, that's the fish's name. It's an *Italian Fucker Fish*."" 

After breathing a sigh of relief the second priest is able to appreciate the fish a bit more. ""Why don't we cook it for our dinner with the His Holiness the Pope tonight"" he says. The first priest agrees and they go their seperate ways, the first priest to return their boat and the second to deliver the fish into the Vatican.

0,Blue Aliens,"A couple is chilling at home when suddenly an UFO lands near their house. Instead of hiding or calling the police, they decide to find out what's going on.

When they arrive the UFO, a door opens and a pair of humanoid blue aliens approaches to the astonished couple.

Male alien: Greetings humans, we come in peace, you don't have to worry. We have learned that this planet contains lifeforms pretty similar to us, and we'd like to have first-hand knowledge about it.
Female alien: We mean we want to have sex intercourses with you.

The human couple is really excited about that, and they agree to get in the house and go to different rooms, each one with a different alien.

They woman is getting undressed, same the male alien, when she sees a really small penis. The alien understands the woman is pretty disappointed and begs the woman to wait for just a minute. Then, the alien starts touching his ears like he was trying to fly with them, and the more he touches, the more the penis grows. After just a few seconds the woman is so nervous about the size she hurries the alien to get into the bed.

Early in the morning she gets out the bedroom and goes downstairs to the living room, completely exhausted, only to find her husband is also there.

Husband: Well... How was it?

Wife: Well, it's been a different experience.

20,Wise decision,"A man gets home after leaving work early and finds his wife in bed with a stranger.

He silently grabs his pistol, making sure that he doesn't get noticed by his wife and her lover, and prepares to shoot them both.

Suddenly, a few thoughts come to his mind. He started to remember the previous six months.

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason, his wife stopped asking him for money to buy new clothes, yet every other week, she came home with new clothes, new shoes, new earrings.

Their kids stopped going to public school. This year, they started going to that fancy private school with a very good reputation.

The new car, yeah that's right, his wife got a new car. He always thought it was a little weird, given that he doesn't get a raise in nearly 5 years, he can barely save money for himself, and his income is supposed to be higher than hers, but he never really gave it any thought.

Now that he thinks about it, despite his shit income, he's been eating like a king these past few months. There has always been food at the table, good food, steak every week, quality wine every so often, the fridge is full, he's been eating pretty much what he wants when he wants.

Bills? He now remembers that he's not been seeing them for a while. For some reason, the bills stopped being a problem, and now that he thinks about it, he never got to question why.

Life has been very good.

&amp;nbsp;

He looks at his wife again, she's having sex with that stranger, a man he's never seen before in his life, shamelessly using his wife like she belongs to him, in that same bed he sleeps in.

Feelings of rage and disgust cloud his brain, he has the finger on the trigger, he's ready to shoot. But he starts thinking again.

&amp;nbsp;

The truth was that his wife was a bomb. She's well in her forties, yet her beauty remains the same as when she was young, that woman seems imune to aging, even after giving birth to 2 kids. She had a good pair of tits, a round delicious booty, and sex with her was simply amazing.

Hell, seeing her in action right now was just reinforcing the idea of how perfect she was in bed.

&amp;nbsp;

He stood there silent for one more minute, pointing his pistol at his wife and her lover, while reflecting on those thoughts.

Then, he silently puts his pistol back in its place, and slowly leaves the room, still careful so he doesn't get noticed.

He says to himself:

-The motherfucker pays for my wife's clothes, buys her a new car, pays for the kids private school, pays for the food so I get to eat like a king for free, and he even pays all our bills. Yet, at the end of the day, I still get to have passionate sex with my hot wife when I get home every day...

&amp;nbsp;

He closes the door behind him, and laughing, reaches the conclusion:

One guy has a complaint, though. ""What's with all these ducks? They're everywhere and getting underfoot!""  

St. Peter looks alarmed, and says ""You must NEVER step on a duck! Those are God's favorite! If you step on a duck, you'll be punished for all eternity!""  

The three are left to their own devices, but inevitably one of them steps on a duck. After much quacking ensued, St. Peter sternly marches up and handcuffs the offender to the ugliest woman the three have ever seen. ""You were warned! Now you're attached to her for all eternity!""  

The other two are now much more careful about trying to avoid stepping on ducks, but as luck would have it, one of them manages to do so, to the same scenario with an even uglier woman.  

The remaining man is so careful he can hardly move, but manages to go for several years without stepping on a duck.  

In spite of this, he sees St. Peter sternly approaching him with a woman and a pair of handcuffs. But the woman isn't ugly, she's drop-dead gorgeous!  

""I wonder what I did to deserve this?"" mused the man.

64,"Green, pink and purple polka-dot ping pong balls","So, a few years ago, I met the owner of a multimillion dollar company, and he decided to tell me a very strange story.

The man told me that he had a son, for whom he cared about deeply, so much so that for his 15th birthday, he offered him anything he wanted in the world.

In response, the son said 
“Thank you father, but I believe I already have enough. I don’t require anything else... except maybe one thing...”

The father said
“Yes, anything! If you want it, it is yours! You just have to ask.”

The son replied
“Alright... I would like...a ping pong ball, please”

“A...ping pong ball?”

“Yes. More specifically, a green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball. Just one will do.”

The father was obviously confused, but did what his son asked. The next day, the son unwrapped his only present, and found the green pink and purple polka dot ping pong ball that he had asked for. He was delighted, and he took the ping pong ball up to his room, locking himself inside. After a few hours, the he emerged. The ping pong ball was gone. The boy never mentioned what he did with it, or why he wanted it.

One year later, and it’s the boys 16th birthday. Again, the father tells him that he can have anything he wants, he simply has to ask.

“Well father, you are very kind, but I believe I already have enough. I require nothing else... except maybe one thing.”

“Whatever you want, son”

“Well... I would like... a pack of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please.”

One year later, and it’s the boys 18th birthday. Before the father can even make the offer, the boy says 

“A truck full of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls, please!”

The father is now seriously concerned, but nevertheless follows his sons wishes.

The boy is delighted, and as expected, he takes the truckload of ping pong ball up to his room, locking himself inside. Hours later, he emerges.
Every last pallet is gone. The boy never mentions what he did with them, or why he wanted them.

One year later, and it’s the boys 19th birthday.

At this point, the father is thinking about hiring a doctor, but nevertheless he follows his sons wishes. The next day, the takes his son to a warehouse filled with millions of pallets of green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls.

“My son... we both know you may not have much time left in this world... so please, answer me honestly... what did you do with those green, pink and purple polka dot ping pong balls?”

The son smiles

“Ah yes...those wonderful green.... purple... and pink folks dot... ping pong balls. Father, I think it’s time. I think that I’m going to tell you now. There’s no use hiding it any longer. You see, the reason I wanted those green, pink and purple polka dot ping balls... what I did with them... the truth is-“

101,There was a vulture who had a rebellious son.,"He would preen his feathers so they stood up, hang out with raccoons, and generally be a nuisance to the rest of the flock. Thinking that it was just a phase, his father didn't worry too much about it and hoped that one day his son would grow up.

However, one day his son came home with terrible news: ""Dad, I've made up my mind I'm going vegetarian!""

He could accept anything else, but that! Shocked, he threw his son out of his house.

As the months and years went by, he regretted his decision, and decided that maybe he should try to understand his son's point of view. So he read up about the nutritional value of plants, looked up recipes, and even asked the neighbouring squirrels about what they ate.

Finally, one cold evening, he decided that it was time to try out eating plants. Peas were a good place to start- they were high in protein, like the rotting flesh he usually ate, and they were easy for him to eat with his beak. So in addition to his usual plate of roadkill, he put on a pot of peas to boil.

Suddenly there was a knock at the door. He opened it and gasped with surprise- there was his son, thin as sticks and weak as water! The son collapsed into his wings, and managed to croak out,

""Dad, I'm starving. Do you have anything for me to eat?""

Crying at seeing his long-lost son after so many years, he nodded and said,

When he went to the post office to send the letter, he met the mail deliverer Kurt. Kurt said he would deliver the letter.

The man waited a few days and went back to the post office since he didn't receive a letter back. He saw Kurt and asked him if he delivered the letter. Kurt said he tried to, but no one answered or took the letter, so he brought it back the next day.

The man was upset that his daughter ignored him. He left a copy of the same letter every single day at the post office, in the hopes that she would answer one of them someday.

Kurt noticed the man sending letter after letter, day by day, for months. His curiosity got the better of him after some time, and he decided to read one of the letters before delivering it. He was astounded at how useful the man's advice was and decided this was worth sharing with everyone, so he called up a local newspaper company.

The newspaper company sent a reporter to come speak with Kurt, who told them, ""A man sent the same letter every day for months to his daughter, who never answered the letters. Read the letter! It has some very good information that could help the whole world out.""

The reporter, instead of being interested in what the letter said, was interested in the man's dedication of sending the same letter every day to someone who never responded. The reporter wrote an article and sent it to Kurt to look at before publishing.

Some thought of her as just another sweet old lady, some called her nuts, but only a few knew about her past.
In her younger days, she slept around quite a bit. She did all the drugs she could get her hands on and seduced every man in sight.
She had so many kids because of all of the guys nutting inside of her. She was convinced that that was her life, but when her best friend was brutally shot in the head just next to her, she changed her ways and became the nice lady she was known as in her village. One particular day, she waved to a rebellious teenager skateboarding past her house. He did not take kindly to her greeting and yelled “You’re nuts!” She said to herself “Huh, funny, everyone calls me nuts. I’ve never tried a nut in my life!” She went to the market and spent a good amount of money on tree nuts, walnuts, peanuts, all different kinds of nuts. She loved every last one of them and bought as many nuts as she could. She was going to purchase some more one day, but she noticed she had no money left to support her family. She had to get rid of something, and eventually with a sad farewell, she sold her nuts. Surprisingly, there was a massive demand for her nuts. She was earning loads of money, and she realized she could sell these for a living. She opened up a business and earned enough money to support her family for the rest of their lives. But that was 3 years ago, and nowadays her company is one of the most well known in the world. So if you ever need nuts, just go to Dee’s Nuts!",Jokes,1572634805,jjtaddz,6,3,True,2019-11-01

163,Brunette on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'," 

A contestant, Sally, on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' had reached the final plateau.

If she answered the next question correctly, she would win $1,000,000. If she answered incorrectly, she would pocket only the $25,000 milestone money.

And as she suspected the Million Dollar Question was no pushover.

It was, 'Which of the following species of birds does not build it's own nest but instead lays its eggs in the nests of other birds?""

Is it:

A) the condor

B) the buzzard

C) the cuckoo

D) the vulture

The woman was on the spot. She did not know the answer.

She had used up her 50/50 Lifeline and her Ask the Audience Lifeline.

All that remained was her Phone-a-Friend Lifeline.

She hoped she would not have to use it because... Her friend was, well, a blonde.

But she had no alternative. She called her friend and gave her the question and the four choices. The blonde responded unhesitatingly:

'That's easy. The answer is C: the cuckoo.'

The contestant had to make a decision and make it fast.

She considered employing a reverse strategy and giving any answer except the one that her friend had given her.

And considering her friend was a blonde that would seem to be the logical thing to do. But her friend had responded with such confidence, such certitude, that the contestant could not help but be convinced.

Crossing her fingers, the contestant said, 'C: The cuckoo.'

'Is that your final answer?'

'Yes, that is my final answer.'

'That answer is Absolutely correct!

You are now a millionaire!'

Three days later, the contestant hosted a party for her family and friends, including the blonde who had helped her win the million dollars.

'Jeni, I just do not know how to thank you, ' said the contestant. 'How did you happen to know the right answer?'

'Oh, come on,' said the blonde 'Everybody knows that cuckoos don't build nests. They live in clocks.'

A few months pass and seeing as the old man had no job was contacted by the IRS to discuss his income.

The old man arrives with his lawyer to speak with the IRS agent. The agent asks where and how do you deposit all this money?

The old man explains I know how to gamble.

Impossible no man can gamble daily and deposit as much as you do

Ok let's make a bet. I bet you $500 I can lick my eye.

The agent observes him for a minute and say fine $500.

The old man pops out his glass eye and licks it.

The IRS agent in disbelief he just lost $500 said that it wasn't enough proof.

Alright fine I bet you $1000 I can bite my other eye with my teeth.

The agent took a minute and made sure there was absolutely know way it was possible and said ok $1000.

The old man pops out his dentures and bites his other eye. 

The agent now in total dismay but still wanting to win said that he still wasn't convinced that he couldnt make this much money daily off cheep gimyics like this. 

So the old man said you're right here's how I make my real money. I bet you $50000 I can stand on the opposite side of your desk sideways and piss in the can without spilling a drop on your desk.

The agent looked carefully and thought hard measured the desk and the distance and finally agreed $5000 but not a single drop.

The old man stands to one side of the desk and pees all over the place. Soiling all the documents on the agents desk and soaking his chair in urine.

The agent begins jumping with joy and celebrating that he just got $5000 from the old man.  Meanwhile the man's lawyer was crying.

Curious the agent asked what was wrong to which the lawyer responded I bet him $30000 he couldn't piss on your desk and have you be happy about it.....",Jokes,1572649914,jrnaz95,8,26,True,2019-11-01

494,There was a man in Jamaica who had only one testicle. Jamaicans being Jamaicans gave him the street name 'Onestone'.,"He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.

After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, ""If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!""

The word got around and nobody called him that any more.

Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, "" Good morning, Onestone.'

He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.

He made love to her all the next day,

Until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.

&amp;#x200B;

The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.

&amp;#x200B;

Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.

Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.

She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'

Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,

Then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day,

Made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!

105,Jim and bob are working,"Jim and bob are working for the same big international company. They get underpaid and the workload is huge. At some point during the friday lunch Jim just has enough and goes ""That's it! I'm going to quit and I'll show them who's boss.""

He stands up and like a mad bull rages towards the CEO office. He slams the door open to find a suprised CEO in the middle of a conference call. Before the CEO can react, Jim unzips his pants, steps on the desk and proceeds to piss all over the CEO and his desk. Jim leaves nothing untouched, including the company awards, the thousands of dollars of cigars and the CEO's new suit. After finishing he zips up his pants and yells out ""You'll never see me again you \*sshole"". 

Bob ran after Jim and witnessed the entire situation in shock and horror. When Jim passed him on his way out he said to Bob ""I suggest you to do the same thing"".

Over the course of the weekend Bob talks to his wife and mentions Jim's heroic action. Jane encourages Bob to do the same thing.

Next friday during lunch Bob finally decides he too is brave enough and in a blind fury rages towards the CEO's newly decorated office. Sure enough, the CEO is in another conference call when Bob barges in. Like Jim, Bob also unzips his pants, stands on the desk and proceeds to piss all over the now furious CEO and his desk. When Bob is finished he zips his pants back up, steps of the desk and yells out:

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can\\! Each Google drive link has a [Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/) link that is a backup just in case one is slow or unavailable. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the head space, which has obvious advantages. Three it pointed out impersonators of B:S. because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information.

The agent must then make the announcement at the village square, to let them all know what’s going on.

He gets to the podium, surrounded by angry sheep herders, blacksmiths, and carpenters from the village and speaks:

“Hear me, villagers, hear me all! Big Pharma is responsible for these deaths! It’s Big Pharma you should be angry at!”

The villagers become enraged, light torches, and organize a mob, ready to avenge these deaths, and they run down the road to a quiet old man’s house and begin beating the man with clubs and sticks, spitting in his face.

197,An old joke from Isaac Asimov(fairly long).,"As is well known, in this thirtieth century of ours, space travel is fearfully dull and time-consuming. In search of diversion, many crew Members defy the quarantine restrictions and pick up pets from the various habitable worlds they explore.

Jim Sloane had a rockette, which he called Teddy. It just sat there, looking like a rock, but sometimes it lifted a lower edge and sucked in powdered sugar. That was all it ate. No one ever saw it move, but every once in a while, it wasn’t quite where people thought it was. There was a theory that it moved when no one was looking.

Bob Laverty had a heli-worm he called Dolly. It was green and carried on photosynthesis. Sometimes it moved to get into better light and when it did so it coiled its wormlike body and inched along very slowly like a turning helix.

One day, Jim Sloane challenged Bob Laverty to a race. ” My Teddy,” he said, “can beat your Dolly.”

“Your Teddy,” scoffed Laverty, “doesn’t move.”

“Bet!” said Sloane.

The whole crew got into the act. Even the captain risked half a credit. Everyone bet on Dolly. At least she moved.

Jim Sloane covered it all. He had been saving his salary through three trips and he put every millicredit of it on Teddy.

The race started at one end of the grand salon. At the other end, a heap of sugar had been placed for Teddy and a spotlight for Dolly. Dolly formed a coil at once and began to spiral its way very slowly toward the light. The watching crew cheered it on.

Teddy just sat there without budging.

“Sugar, Teddy, Sugar,” said Sloane, pointing. Teddy did not move. It looked more like a rock than ever, but Sloane did not seem concerned.

Finally, when Dolly had spiraled halfway across the salon, Jim Sloane said casually to his rockette, “if you don’t get out there, Teddy, I’m going to get a hammer and chip you into pebbles.”

That was when people first discovered that rockettes could read minds. That was also when people first discovered that rockettes could teleport.

Sloane had no sooner made his threat when Teddy simply disappeared from his place and reappeared on top of the sugar.

Sloane won, of course, and he counted his winnings slowly and luxuriously.

Laverty said bitterly, “You knew the damn thing could teleport.”

“No, I didn’t,” said Sloane, “but I knew he would win. It was a sure thing.”

“How come?”

“It’s an old saying everyone knows. … Sloane’s Teddy wins the race.”",Jokes,1570054370,thou_hypocrite,17,418,True,2019-10-02

The translator smiles. ""Ah yes, they are difficult to find. This particular tribe has very little interest in Westerners. But they will still meet with you! All you need to do is head to a specific plateau and wait there, after using this phrase."" He uttered a series of Xhosa syllables and clicking sounds. The anthropologist took careful note of the phrase, thanked him, and went on his way. 

He became slightly lost, but eventually found a plateau fitting the description of the translator. He stood on the edge and proceeded to make the clicking sounds. 

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a woman with traditional Xhosa regalia arrived. He tried to recite a greeting, but the woman began rubbing herself all over him and whispering in his ear. 

Unsure what to do next, the anthropologist froze. But a few moments later, the translator arrived and shooed the woman away. Then he laughed heartily. 

""This is the wrong plateau, my friend!"" he said jovially. ""Only prostitutes come to this one!""

330,The Girlfriend Joke,"Now, I need to caveat the beginning of this joke with some information. I'm a solid six-outta-ten, a real average looking guy. Never been too smooth wirth the ladies but whaddaya do, never been lonely neither.
So, one day I come home from work, I live in a little apartment complex, and I see across the hall is this nine-outta-ten girl, hauling boxes into her new place. So I, like the curious neighbor I am, walk up and ask ""Hey, can I give you a hand with those boxes?"" and inthe snootiest, whitest white girl voice I've ever heard she says ""Uhm, no thanks, creep!""
So I walk off, defeated and dejected, and settle in for a night of video games, good pizza and generally a snazzy ol' time.
The next morning, as I'm walking out of my house and locking the door, I hear a much calmer version of the same white girl voice I heard just before, and to protect her identity, I'm just gonna call her Nine. 
Nine says to me, ""I'm so sorry for the way I treated you last night, moving into a new place is so stressful I took it out on you and I shouldn't have done that.""
""Not a problem, sometimes it be like that,"" I respond.
""Can I take you out for dinner tonight as an apology?"" She's starting to get really flirty at this point. Score!
""On one condition, you let me pay, and I take you to a movie as well."" I'm in the clear now!


So Nine and I date for a few weeks and it's going awesomely, she's super hot, she's really sweet and we get busy doing all sorts of stuff you do in the secrecy of your own home with the person you love. Like our taxes.


And then, not too long later, and new girl moves in, one door opposite me. A decent seven-outta-ten, not super hot like Nine, but still cute. So I see her moving boxes the same way and offer to help, and she gladly accepts.
She directs me to bring a loosely-taped, very old worn-down looking box to the living room, and so I do.
I plop the box - carefully - onto the floor, and notice it's full of old 90's era video games, complete woth a snes and a nes, really cool stuff, basically.
So I casually ask her ""is that your boyfriends'box of games"", and she cheerily tells me no. She's an avid gamer, and a major collector of 90's nostalgia. Primo cool stuff, and we form a fast friendship.

So life is great for a few months, Nines and I spend tons of time together, madly in love, and Seven is my new best friend. Until, one day, Nines tells me that she's starting to become really jealous of Seven, which, to be fair, is entirely understandable. If I'm not with one I'm with the other, abd I can see how she might think something is going on.
So I tell her to spend some time with Seven, if she likes me, she'll LOVE Seven, and hopefully they can become fast friends too.

Then it gets weird, Nines tells me that while they were hanging out, Seven threatened to kill her, if she didn't stop seeing me. And Nines is fucking scared man, like, she thinks Seven might actually do something about it. But it's late, so I tell her I'll talk to Seven in the morning.

Morning comes, I knock on Seven's door. No answer.
Text Seven, no answer. Call her, no answer.
Nine's door. Text. Call. Nothing.

So I think maybe they're at work already - or run off to start their own secret romance?

I come home from work, haven't heard from either of them. I'm ghosted for weeks.

And then, I see her. Seven, on the news. Covered in blood. She looks straight into the camera. ""She's dead, you're next."" Cut to a shot of an anchorman, talking about how a woman was murdered. Bites taken out of her flesh.

She's dead, you're next.

They autopsy the body, murder. It was Nines. Parts of her had been eaten.

332,An anthropologist visits a local translator in Zimbabwe.,"""I'd like to set up a meeting with the nearby Xhosa tribe,"" he says. ""But I haven't had any luck finding them. Can you help me send a message?""

The translator smiles. ""Ah yes, they are difficult to find. This particular tribe has very little interest in Westerners. But they will still meet with you! All you need to do is head to a specific plateau and wait there, after using this phrase."" He uttered a series of Xhosa syllables and clicking sounds. The anthropologist took careful note of the phrase, thanked him, and went on his way. 

He became slightly lost, but eventually found a plateau fitting the description of the translator. He stood on the edge and proceeded to make the clicking sounds. 

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a woman with traditional Xhosa regalia arrived. He tried to recite a greeting, but the woman began rubbing herself all over him and whispering in his ear. 

Unsure what to do next, the anthropologist froze. But a few moments later, the translator arrived and shooed the woman away. Then he laughed heartily. 

""This is the wrong plateau, my friend!"" he said jovially. ""Only prostitutes come to this one!""

""Oh, I'm terribly sorry..."" he began. 

""It's perfectly fine, my friend,"" he laughed. ""Just be more careful what you click on. You could have gotten a virus!""",Jokes,1570072122,KairuSmairukon,0,1,True,2019-10-02

The vet calls my hubby 'El-Cheap-O', and my hubby calls the vet 'El-Charge-O'. They love to hate each other and constantly 'snipe' at one another. It's a contest of who can get the better of the other.
The next day my hubby had an appointment with his doctor, who is located in the same building, next door to the vet.
The Dr's waiting room and office was full of people waiting. A side door opened and the vet leaned in - he had obviously seen my hubby arrive.
He looked straight at my hubby and in a loud voice said,
'Your wife's pussy doesn't stink any more. We washed and shaved it, and now she smells like a rose! Oh, and, by the way, she's pregnant! God only knows who the father is!'

The bartender sees him, scared, horrified and sweating that he can't help asking:

""Hey man, I see you very strange, is something wrong?""

“You wouldn't believe it if I told you.”

105,Richard's daughter was getting married.,"She was his princess so he wanted to make her day everything she'd dreamed of. A gorgeous wedding chapel, a gourmet chef for the catering, and  dozens of bottles of the finest champagne to be served in authentic Italian crystal. Except for the fact that Richard was an elementary school teacher and such extravagance was well beyond his means.

He tried going to the banks, but every bank in town turned him down because of his bad credit.

He sold his old comic books and baseball cards but his small collection didn't net him much.

His friends at work scraped together what they could, but even that wasn't enough.

His daughter told him that it didn't matter, that a simple wedding was enough for her; he knew, but he still wanted to spoil his little girl one last time.

One day, he was perusing want ads for a second job and saw a man in a fine suit walking by. A fat envelope dropped out of the man's newspaper and hit the ground. When the man didn't turn around to retrieve it, Richard jogged over and picked it up. He caught up to the man in the suit and tapped him on the shoulder.

The man turned around and speared Richard with a glare.

""Whaddya want?""

""Y-you dropped something."" Richard proffered the envelope to the suited man who snatched it away, opened it, and began counting dozens of hundred dollar bills.

""You didn't take anything. You didn't even open it!"" He seemed incredulous.

""It's not my business to. Have a nice day."" Richard turned to leave but the suited man grabbed his elbow.

""I can't just let you go. If I'd have lost this dough I'd be a dead man. I always repay favors. If you ever need a favor, come here and ask for Paulo."" He slipped a business card into Richard's pocket and strode away.

Later that night Richard decided to take the man up on his offer. The address was a ritzy Italian restaurant he'd never been to. He wore his best suit and rehearsed what he'd ask for if the man was serious about helping.

He walked in the door and felt immediately out of place. At the tables were all sorts of business owners, politicians, and even Hollywood actors. The host took one look at Richard's cheap suit and looked as if he were about to shoo him away.  

Richard cleared his throat and said, ""I'm here to see Paulo.""

The host blinked and gestured for Richard to follow him.

Richard followed the host down a long hallway with increasingly sparse lighting. The noise of the restaurant faded as they walked deeper and deeper into the building. They soon came to an ornamented door and the host knocked a pattern of quick taps. A slot opened up at head height to reveal the face of the man Richard had met earlier. The man nodded to the host, who walked back the way they came.

The man, whom Richard assumed was Paulo, opened the door and beckoned him inside. The door shut behind him and the room was pitch black. Richard felt panic welling up before Paulo opened a door on the other side of the room.

Light flooded through and revealed a well-dressed Italian man behind a rich mahogany desk. He was stroking a white Persian cat while a phonograph played soft opera music.

""I understand you have done a great service for my son Paulo,"" the seated man said, ""and I would be remiss if I didn't return the favor on his behalf. Do you have any questions before we get down to business?""

""Just one, sir. Why don't you have any lights in the other room?""

He was lying on the floor for some reason and had a raging headache and a big bump on his forehead. That probably meant he was getting screamed at, when he got downstairs.

He tried to go to the kitchen, without making to much noise, but on the way he found that he broke a vase. Oh no, that meant more screaming.

But the smelh of fresh coffee, bacon and eggs in the air seemed of of place. Something was seriously wrong. This was not what he expected.

When he entered the kitchen his wife smiled happily at him and told him to sit down. He looked at his son who was already sitting at the table and eating his breakfast, and whispered to him: ""What happened, how much did I screw up?""

His son smiled at him and told him: ""You were shouting in the street, when you came home. But that wasn't enough so you puked over moms roses. Then you were not able to open the front door, so mom had to pick you up. On the way to the bedroom you broke her favourite vase.""

Karl got paler and paler with everything his son told him, he was sure this was his last supper. Why didn't he leave the pup earlier.

His son saw him getting paler, and continued. ""Mom tried to undress you. But when she tried to unzip your pants, you stood up told here 'Excuse me miss, I am happily married. I have to leave.' and tried to leave the bedroom and crashed into the door frame.""

Put sum footprints on the dashboard upsidedown
And since you been with Nelly

233,There once was a man with no arms. [Long],"Despite this fact, when the town church was looking for a new bell toller, he went straight to the church. The pastor didn't believe the man when told he could do the job, but decided to humor him, saying ""If you can ring the bell, the job is yours.""

Excitedly, the man climbed the stairs to the top of the belfry. As the pastor watched, the man took several steps back then ran head first towards the bell, creating the clearest, purist tone the pastor had ever heard.

""Bravo,"" the pastor said, ""the job is yours!"" And so the man dutifully fulfilled his job, day in and day out, announcing the time, church, weddings, funerals, everything.

However, one day there was a powerful storm. Despite this, the man kept to his job and climbed the belfry. He took several steps back, started to run towards the bell, but the wind caught the it, tilting it just enough that the man ran underneath it, off the belfry, and fell to his death.

The town mourned his death and, though no family ever showed, held a funeral for him. Out of respect, the town decided to wait several weeks before looking to hire a new bell toller.

After mourning, an ad was placed. A man walked into the pastor's office and inquired about the position. The pastor looked up, and much to his surprise, there stood the armless man.

""How can you be alive?! You fell three stories!""

""No, pastor, that was my twin brother you hired. He kept in touch with me via mail and had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and the townspeople. When I didn't hear anything from him in several weeks, I wrote him, thinking his message got lost. When I still hadn't heard from him, I came here, and learned of his death along the way. I didn't leave much behind me, so if you would, I'd love to apply for the job.""

After the pastor had collected himself, he obliged, with everything repeating as it had: the man ran head first towards the bell, earning the job, working hard, and falling to his death.

A small crowd gathered around the man's corpse when somebody yelled ""Does anybody know this man?""

Another person replied ""No, but his face sure rings a bell.""",Jokes,1567472326,lephantome92,5,16,True,2019-09-02

I couldn’t help but read a few of the degenerate, brain dead ramblings written on the walls while I was at it. If you’re the person that corrects the grammar of the shit written in a bathroom stall, who’s the real monster? It just reminds me of Facebook. Facebook is the bathroom stall of the internet. People go in and post their shit and *click* flush it on down. Every now and then pricks like to share something on your wall. Leave it to your aunt to post a racist minion meme on your page. She’s okay in person and makes a mean toffee trifle but it’s probably because she’s a triflin’ bitch online. It’s because we have too many meaningless choices on the internet, too many meaningless causes. Imagine a Facebook slot machine where you place bets on the shit you think matters. Okay let’s do “like and share if you love Jesus” ...”don’t tread on me” aaaand “9/11 was an inside job” *pulls the lever* (clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickthunk) FUCK IM STILL POOR!!

Let’s not kid ourselves folks, we are indentured to the subscription living that’s kept us from being too disobedient these past few years. Do you think the CEO of the company you work for gives a shit about you? No!

361,An Australian Army Recruit sends home a letter . . .,"Dear Mum &amp; Dad,

I am well. Hope you're are too. Tell me big brothers Doug and Phil that the Army is better than workin’ on the farm - tell them to get in quick smart before the jobs are all gone! I wuz a bit slow in settling down at first, because ya don’t hafta get outta bed until 6am. But I like sleeping in now, cuz all ya gotta do before brekky is make ya bed and shine ya boots and clean ya uniform. No cows to milk, no calves to feed, no feed to stack - nothin’!! Ya haz gotta shower though, but its not so bad, coz there’s lotsa hot water and even a light to see what ya doing!

At brekky ya get cereal, fruit and eggs but there’s no kangaroo steaks or possum stew like wot Mum makes. You don’t get fed again until noon and by that time all the city boys are dead because we’ve been on a ’route march’ - geez its only just like walking to the windmill in the back paddock!!

This one will kill me brothers Doug and Phil with laughter. I keep getting medals for shootin’ - dunno why. The bullseye is as big as a possum’s bum and it don’t move and it’s not firing back at ya like the Johnsons did when our big scrubber bull got into their prize cows before the Ekka last year! All ya gotta do is make yourself comfortable and hit the target! You don’t even load your own cartridges, they comes in little boxes, and ya don’t have to steady yourself against the rollbar of the roo shooting truck when you reload!

Sometimes ya gotta wrestle with the city boys and I gotta be real careful coz they break easy - it’s not like fighting with Doug and Phil and Jack and Boori and Steve and Muzza all at once like we do at home after the muster.

Turns out I’m not a bad boxer either and it looks like I’m the best the platoon’s got, and I’ve only been beaten by this one bloke from the Engineers - he’s 6 foot 5 and 15 stone and three pick handles across the shoulders and as ya know I’m only 5 foot 7 and eight stone wringin’ wet, but I fought him till the other blokes carried me off to the boozer.

I can’t complain about the Army - tell the boys to get in quick before word gets around how good it is.

Every year, my grandparents invite the entire family over to their place for their annual Labor Day barbecue.
Very rarely, my cousin Samuel decides to come along, and usually only if he's that desperate for a free meal.
Everyone in my family talks mad shit about Samuel, because he used to be a hardcore drug addict, but he tries his hardest to quit and hes really a nice guy so I've never thought poorly of him.
Remember this, as itll come into play later in the story.

Grandpa starts up the grill, and soon enough my dad and all of his brothers are gathered around talking about football or some nonsense.
Out of the blue, Samuel walks into the back yard, and suddenly the entire crowd falls deathly silent.
""Nope,"" my uncle Robert blurts out, ""we are not fucking doing this again this year.""
Near him is a croquet mallet left behind by another of my cousins, and Robert picks it up like hes going to start swinging it.
Aunt Wendy, Samuel's mom, screams bloody fucking murder, but doesn't lift a finger to help her poor son, who flees back to the front yard as fast as he can.

Grandpa and the rest of his sons follow Robert as he chases Samuel down, but not one of them tells him to cut it out.
I blow my top, however, and full-on sprint to put myself between my uncle and my cousin.
Very forcefully, I take the shovel from Robert's hand and throw it over the fence into his neighbor's lawn.
Every one of my family members looks at me like I've just defaced the Holy Grail, but that doesn't stop me from exploding.

""You ought to be fucking ashamed of yourself!
Over and over you keep punishing Samuel for his past mistakes, but you never give him a chance to show you how hes changed!""
Ultimately, my uncle returned to the party with the rest of my family, his tail between his legs, but not before making it very clear that I was never allowed to his home again.

Upset about what transpired, Samuel tried to apologize to me for ruining my relationship with Uncle Robert.

410,The Weary Soldier," The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well-dressed middle-aged lady and was being used by her little dog.

The war-weary soldier asked: ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said; ""You Americans, you are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?"" The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog. Again he asked: ""Please, lady, may I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!""

The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.

An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up; ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

Martha replied, ""Stumpy, that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars.""

The bartender pours the drink but says, ""Now, before I give you this, why don't you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?"" 

The man begins his tale. ""Well, I was sitting in the bar next-door, when this gorgeous blonde slinks in and actually sits beside me. I thought, 'Wow, this has never happened before.' You know, it was kind of a fantasy come true. Well, a couple of minutes later, I feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans over, licks my ear, and asks if I'm interested. I couldn't believe this was happening. I managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand and starts walking out of the bar. So, of course, I went with her. This was just too good to be true."" 

He continues, ""She took me down the street to a nice hotel and up to her room. As soon as she shut the door, she slipped out of her dress. That was all she was wearing! I tell you, it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes. But as soon as I jumped into the bed, I heard some keys jingling and someone starts fumbling with the door."" 

The blonde says, 'Oh, my god, it's my boyfriend. He must have lost his wrestling match tonight. He's gonna be real mad. Quick, hide!' 

I opened the closet, but I figured that was probably the first place he would look, so I didn't hide there. Then I looked under the bed, but I figured that he's bound to look there, too. By now, I could hear the key in the lock. I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my fingers, praying that the guy wouldn't see me..."" 

The bartender says, ""Well, I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this point."" 

""Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open, and he yells, 'Who you been sleeping with now, witch?' 

The girl says, 'Nobody, honey, now come to bed and calm down.' 

Well, the guy starts tearing up the room. I hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. I'm thinking, 'Boy, I'm glad I didn't hide in there.' Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. Good thing I didn't hide under there either. Then I heard him say, 'What's that over there by the window?' 

I think, 'Oh God, I'm dead meat now.' 

But by now the blonde is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking. Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long time. I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden, the jerk pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right on top of my head. I mean, look at this, I got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!"" 

The bartender says, ""Oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure."" 

""No, that didn't really bother me. Next, the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. I mean, look at my fingers. They're a bloody mess. I can hardly hold this glass."" 

The bartender looks at the guy's hands and says, ""Yeah, buddy, I can understand why you are so upset.""

The princess said that she'll mary the prince who would make the best impression on her. So all of those young men were looking for advice and visited an Old Wise Man, who told them that the key to success is to look down and to show what's there.

Soon the audience with the princess began...

The first one, the most athletic, took the advice literally - he looked down below his waist, lowered his pants in front of the princess and presented what he has to offer.

The second one, the most greedy, took the advice metaphorically - he looked down below his feet, grabbed a handful of soil, and told the princess that they can merge the land they live on and make a bigger profit.

The third one, the most lazy, just looked down into the comments section and told her the highest upvoted joke. The princess appreciated his sense of humour, got married and they lived happily ever after.
