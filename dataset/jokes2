74,Tequila Bets,"A man walks into a bar, notices a very large jar on the counter, and sees that it's filled to the brim with $10 notes. 
He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it. He approaches the bartender and asks, 
""What's with the money in the jar?""
""Well.., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Maserati."" 
The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""

So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar. 
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: 

First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it

""Second -
There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth.  You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""

""Third -
There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem.""

The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 -- but I'm not an idiot!
I won't do it!  You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila
and then do all those other things!""

""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is.""

As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says,
""Where's the damn tequila?!""

He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.
Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn’t make a face -- and he drinks 
it in 58 seconds!
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole.
Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight --
then nothing but silence!

Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar.
His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.

201,In light of people getting slapped by the pope.,"There was this poor old guy named Donald who hears that the pope is going on tour and will be parading through his town. Donald was very excited that he might get a chance to meet the pope and shake his hand. So he decided to make a plan. He thought that the pope would want to meet the richest man in town. Donald thought that if were somehow able to appear rich, stand by the road, the pope would see him, be impressed, stop and Donald would get to shake the pope’s hand.

So poor old Donny went out and bought a nice new expensive suit that he couldn’t really afford, and on the appointed day, got up early, put on his new suit, went out and got a neat comb-over haircut, and made his way to the edge of the road where the pope would soon be driving by. 

After what seems like an eternity, he finally spots the motorcade, and old Donny boy begins to get tingly with anticipation. As it gets closer and closer, it suddenly stops right in front of him. The pope gets down out of the p-mobile, walks toward Donald, and without even looking at him, walks past him toward a scruffy little guy sitting obliviously against a wall. The little guy is wearing nasty, dirty clothes and is drunk as a skunk. The pope, arms folded, stands silently over the drunk who finally looks up. The pope unfolds his arms, slowly leans down and says something to the drunkard that nobody could hear. The drunkard, smiling stupidly, then gets up and hobbles down the street as the pope makes his way back to his po-mo. 

Donald is momentarily confused, but then it dawns on him. Of course! The pope doesn’t want to meet rich people. He wants to meet downtrodden, poor people! So he goes to plan-b and runs after the drunk guy. When he catches up to him, big Donny offers to swap clothes with him. Of course the man immediately agrees. So they go behind a couple of bushes and proceed with their transaction. Donald is momentarily overcome by the stench of his new clothes, but tells himself that sacrifices must be made and off he runs after the slow moving papal motorcade.

Like F. Gump, he runs and runs and finally catches up to the motorcade. Donny goes a little ways farther, stops and sits down just like the drunk guy did, to wait for the popemobile to pass by. Sure enough, as it gets to him, it stops. Donald is beyond excited as the pope jumps down and walks toward him. Just as before, with arms crossed and with a stern, pious expression, the pope stands over Donald. After a few seconds, he leans down in Donald’s face and quietly snarls, “I thought I told you to get the hell out of here.”",Jokes,1578179043,Vortesian,2,8,True,2020-01-04

Nervously he followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her bathrobe to fall off completely.

Now nude, she purred at him......... 'What would you say is my best feature?'

The attention seeker of the group, James, adamantly responded there's no way the actual activity of snorting could possibly harm your nose, and the destruction of the schnauzer was the fault of whatever substance was snorted.

Several members of the group challenged this, and back and forth ensued, until an agreement was reached. James would try it himself, without the substance part.

Issue was, the only consumable we had handy was fruit punch. The group began boiling down a small batch to be placed into a snortable less liquidy form. Credit cards were unsheathed, ready to swipe and manipulate the gooey substance into a snortable line. The scene was set and the challenge was nearing.

So, the man opened the first door and saw a room full of people, standing on their heads on a concrete floor. Not very nice, he thought.

Opening the second door, he saw a room full of people standing on their heads on a wooden floor. Better, he thought, but best to check the last door.

Upon opening the last door, he saw a room full of people, standing waist-deep in excrement and sipping coffee.

""Of the three, this one looks best,"" he said and waded in to get something to drink while Satan closed the door.

A few minutes later the door opened, Satan stuck his head in and said, ""Ok, coffee break's over, back on your heads!""",Jokes,1578209051,melizzabell,12,32,True,2020-01-05

465,Let me introduce the little known tale of Curtis Remond.,"Curtis was born in the small town of New York, the only child of a rich and famous banking family. Curtis’ father was a banker. Curtis’ grandfather was a banker. The banking linage runs as far back in the family as time can remember, ever since Gerald Redmond had emigrated from Killarney back in the 1840’s to escape the potato famine ravaging the emerald isle at the time.

As such, Curtis was brought up in the so called proper way. He was sent to the prestigious Browning School for his studies, and his every need and whim was catered for by a small army of household staff, there to dress him in the morning, wash him at night and even be on hand with a tissue if he even as much as sneezed.

While young Curtis appreciated the life that his parents were trying to make for him, he slowly began to resent the pampered existence he grew up in. His father was never around, always working late in the office, while his mother was more focused on her burgeoning cosmetic business than caring for her developing offspring. While he was a bright kid, as he grew into his, his rebellious streak came to the fore. He started skipping school, instead hanging around the streets of the Big Apple with some of the more undesirable types that his parents had tried to shelter him from. He learnt about different types of upbringing, and that people can make it on their own way, and not follow the set path that their parents wanted but still be happy and successful. However, Curtis felt a little alienated by this environment, due to his upper-class upbringing, and started using the nickname “Red” in an attempt to fit in with his new social circle.

Obviously, his father was not happy with this situation. He had hoped Curtis would follow in the family tradition, and it all came to a head one Christmas Eve, which happened to be Curtis’ 16th birthday. They had a blazing row, and Curtis was thrown out of the family home. Left with nowhere to go, but he just wanted at that time to be as far away from his parents as possible, so using a credit card stolen from his father, he booked the next available flight to Anchorage, Alaska.

However, as previously mentioned, Red was a clever and personable guy. Once in Alaska, he quickly found work and lodging with the Hamilton’s, a loving family of sheep herders on the outskirts of the city. He adored this new lifestyle and the freedom he’d never before encountered in his life. He swiftly grew attached to his new venture and vowed never to return to the city from where he’d been raised.

Red also found love. Alice was the beautiful daughter of the farming family, and Alice and Red married at 18, in a small ceremony on the Hamilton’s farm. Red did invite his parents, but they didn’t even give him the courtesy of responding. The newlywed couple started their own smallholding, and Alice gave birth to their first child, who they named Kai. The new family kindled close friendships within the sheep herding community, and before long young Kai was accompany Red on his farming duties. These often extending into the twilight hours, especially in winter where daylight in Alaska is at a premium, so the majority of the time they and the other farmers were working using flashlights and head-lamps.

However, after a while Red noticed an odd phenomenon. Whenever he brought Kai out to help round up the sheep at the end of the night, the all the light sources flickered and eventually went out. They changed bulbs, put in brand new batteries, but this kept happening. No-one had known such a strange occurrence before, and there seemed to be no explanation. Obviously, this was effecting their work, and bereft of any other ideas, they turned to Fred, the oldest and longest serving farmer in the village.

After explaining the situation, Fred let out a sigh. “There is a simple reason for this”, Fred explained, “It is an old farmers adage”

My mate a bit confused asked me what was going on, and as such I explained how the town had numbered all of our well known jokes so he asked if he could participate and if so how. I told my mate just get up and say a number, so he stands up and he says number 11 but he only gets a few chuckles.

66,Superhero Beach,"Before I write the joke, I wanted to give credit to who it came from. I worked as a reporter very briefly, and we had an older fella that would always tell us one joke a day. He was a great guy and I just wanted to pass on one of his jokes that always stood out to me, so here it is.

If you were to ask who the fastest superhero is, there are a few that come to mind. Realistically, The Flash, fastest man alive, is your guy.

Well, superheroes are like us, they get stressed and overworked too. So, they all have different ways of unwinding and decompressing.

Well, Flash decides to go to the beach, but this isn’t just any beach, this is a nude beach.

As he is walking around, he sees some friends from his universe and others as well. Hawk Girl playing volleyball, cheating of course because she can fly, her big ol’ tits smacking around. He sees The Hulk walking, footprints behind him with a thick line in the sand between them.

Trying to divert his gaze, he looks down toward the end of the beach and sees the most stunning creature ever, Wonder Woman. She is just laying there, sunglasses on, ignoring everything, just sprawled out.

“Man, what I wouldn’t do to have sex with a woman like that...” Flash says to himself. After a moment of humoring the thought, he thinks, “I mean, I am the fastest man alive... I could go over there, so whatever I want, then leave before anyone knew anything...”

Hyping himself up before he could second guess himself, Flash darts over to Wonder Woman, does his business and then leaves in a flash chuckling to himself. “I just had sex with Wonder Woman!”

In the burst of air that passes as he disappears down the beach further, Wonder Woman props herself up on her elbows, takes her sunglasses off, and fixed her hair as she looks around. Confused, she asks, “What in the world was that?”

Meanwhile, the Invisible Man on top of her replies, “I don’t know, but my ass sure hurts.”",Jokes,1575566695,KingReejer,0,1,True,2019-12-05

Since he was the only capable hunter in the kingdom, he agreed. But he was worried that the Queen may use this opportunity to cheat on him. 

So he came up with a brilliant idea. He ordered the Queen to hide a sharp blade inside her pussy. He thought whoever fucked the queen  may end up with a broken penis. She agreed. 

The King then went to hunting for couple of days. He returned from the hunting trip and ordered every ministers on the court to pull down their pants and stand in a queue. He personally checked every minster penis one by one. 

He was astonished to find that everyone shagged the Queen and end up with a bleeding ruptured penis. He ordered death sentence to everyone on the spot. 

Last in the queue was his most trusted minister and a close friend of him. His penis was still intact without a single bleeding mark. He was very happy to know that his close friend was the only loyal minister in the kingdom. He decided to award his loyalty and looked at his face to thank him.

133,Politically Correct Santa,"**Politically Correct Santa**

'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...
How to live in a world that's politically correct?

His workers no longer would answer to ""Elves,""
""Vertically Challenged"" they were calling themselves.

And labour conditions at the north pole
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.

Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.

And equal employment had made it quite clear
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.

So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!

The runners had been removed from his sleigh;
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.

And people had started to call for the cops
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.

Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.
His fur-trimmed red suit was called ""Unenlightened.""

And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose

And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.

So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,
Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,

Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.

And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.

Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.

Nothing that might be construed to pollute.
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.

Nothing that clamoured or made lots of noise.
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.

Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.
Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.

No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.

And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.

For they raised the hackles of those psychological
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.

No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.

Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.

So Santa just stood there, dishevelled, perplexed;
He just could not figure out what to do next.

He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,
But you've got to be careful with that word today.

His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.

Something special was needed, a gift that he might
Give to all without angering the left or the right.

A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,
Each group of people, every religion;

Every ethnicity, every hue,
Everyone, everywhere...even you.

So here is that gift, its price beyond worth...
""May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.
After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.
So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

14,Four friends in college wanted to start a band.,"Juan, Fred, Ryan, and Yasmine were all somewhat musically inclined, and they wanted to start a rock band. So, one Saturday evening, they all met in Juan's garage to begin work on a new song. After practicing for a few hours, they realized their band still needed a name. 

""We need something *metal*"", said Fred.

""How about just using our initials, like ABBA did?"" offered Ryan. 

The group agreed with Ryan's idea, and so they continued practicing.

A few weeks later they completed their first album, which they titled *Himself*. The album instantly became popular in the area, and its songs played frequently on the college's radio station. As they enjoyed their success, Yasmine pointed out that they should keep making music. Thus, they decided to create an extended play for the next year. Fred, still disappointed that the band's name wasn't ""metal"" enough, suggested they should call the recording *Stein*. 

""It literally means *rock*, and it's in German, which makes it extra metal!"" he proclaimed.

The other band members all applauded this idea, and so the new EP was recorded. The college town awaited eagerly for the release of their new EP, remembering the quality of their previous album. However, *Stein* didn't do nearly as well in sales, so the college radio station continued playing *Himself* instead. This remained the band's most popular album, and the new EP was simply unable to overtake it.

The next morning the local paper's headline read:

30,A man and his wife welcome a beautiful baby boy... (long),"And what a beautiful boy he was. The doctors said that he was the most beautiful baby they had ever seen. Strong, attentive, curious, and very happy/content. The man could not have been more proud.

A few years down the road, the boy was running and jumping and developing much faster than his peers at the same age. The man beamed with pride looking down at his little boy. On his third birthday, he won a race at his pre-school and the man was so proud he exclaimed to the boy: ""lets go to the toy store! whatever you want, I will buy for you""

The little boy was thrilled. Off to the toy store they went, and he chose to buy 100 pink ping pong balls. The man tried to persuade him towards some action figures, and a new soccer ball. But the boy wanted the ping pong balls, and so thats what he got. 

A few years down the road, the boy was graduating from his elementary school. Top of his class, straight A's. The pride of the school. He was the fastest, the smartest, and most well liked kid there. Again, the man was beaming with immense pride. He says to his son ""lets go buy you a gift! what do you want? anything you want! It is yours!"" 

The boy looks at his father and says ""you know what Dad, I've thought about it - and I would really like 100 pink ping pong balls"" - The man couldn't believe it. Of all the things that a young boy could possibly want, ping pong balls? It didn't make any sense! But of course, he acquiesced and purchased what his son wanted. 

High school rolls around, and things keep getting better for the young man.  Quarterback of the football team. Dating the most beautiful girl in school. Valedictorian. Owns and operates a small business and is a well respected member of the community. For his graduation present, his father goes all out. Party, gifts, and he poses to him a question: ""Son, I want to buy you a car for your graduation gift. Lets go to the dealership and pick out any car on the lot"" - his son replies ""wow, Dad. That is incredible. But instead, could you possibly get me 100 pink ping pong balls?"" 

Again, the man was floored. Here he was, offering to provide him with the car that would make any young man jealous - and he wants ping pong balls??? He asks his son, ""why?"" - and his son coolly replies: ""Dad, it's what I want"" - so sure enough, he goes on Amazon and has 100 pink ping pong balls delivered to the house. 

Fast forward. College graduation from Harvard Medical School. On his way to becoming a heart surgeon. With tears in his eyes after the ceremony the father looks at his son and says to him: ""Now? Now can I buy you something amazing? Please. It is all that I want to do."" The son replies ""You know what Dad? I could really use 100 pink ping pong balls"" - This time, the man knows that resistance is futile and orders the ping pong balls. Whatever, right? If it makes his boy happy, than that is all that matters.

A few years down the road, the young man and his high school sweetheart are planning the wedding of their dreams. He is a successful Heart Surgeon, top of his profession. As they are planning the wedding reception, the father says ""son, I am retired now, and you've given me so much to be proud of. Can I please buy you a house? A car? A vacation? Something? Tell me what you would like your wedding gift to be, and I will make it happen"" - The son replies ""well Dad, now that my wife and I are to be making decisions together - we talked about it. What we would like is 100 pink ping pong balls"" - I mean, what is the Man to do? He doesn't understand it, he has long since given up on asking why. He just knows that he is proud and he will do anything he can to make sure that his son is happy. 

At the wedding reception, a man bursts into the room and runs up to the young Groom. ""Sir, I need you to come with me. The President of the United States just collapsed with a triple bypass. You are the only man that can save his life!!""- So the Young Man leaves his wedding, and performs an exhausting surgery and saves the life of the President. A few months later, he is at the white house receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The highest civilian honor in the land. 

The young Man leans over to his father and the Father says: ""Son, I am so proud to be your Father"" - and the Son replies: ""Hey, howabout that sports car now?""

The old Man couldn't believe his ears. On the way home from Washington, they stopped at a Ferrari dealership and he says to his son ""pick any one you want"" - and the Son goes to town, picks the nicest Ferrari on the lot and says to the salesman ""This one"" - As they are out test driving it, an 18 wheeler runs a red light and smashes into them. They are rushed to a nearby hospital and a few days later, the Old Man learns that his Son's injuries are too many to sustain life. 

As he comes in to say his last words to his boy, he tells him how proud he is of him. How he's a good man, a good husband, a great son, and the pride and joy of his life. Then, he works up the courage and says ""there's just one thing I have to know. In every milestone of your life, I offered you the world, and all you ever wanted was 100 pink ping pong balls. Why? Why the car now? What was it all for? Please, tell me. I have to know"" 

The son motions for his father to come closer. He says ""Dad..."" and then he dies.",Jokes,1572969303,Rvjones55,18,7,True,2019-11-05

49,The Death of Joe K,"Folks in Boston are all familiar with a man named Joseph Kendall. In particular, Joseph Kendall is well-known among the regulars in a bar called The Post. In The Post, he's usually known as Joe K, seeing as there's another Joe; Joseph Loggins.

Joseph Loggins, or Joe L, is pretty well-liked by everyone he meets. He's polite, generous, charming, and funny. Joe L once donated one of his kidneys to save a stranger's life. Joe L buys his coworkers presents at Christmas. Joe L spends his free hours volunteering for the homeless, and somehow still finds time to bake delicious treats he shares freely.

 Joe K, on the other hand, is a real bastard. He's cantankerous, a cheapskate, rude, and never pays his tab. Joe K picks fights with drunk strangers, kicks dogs on the street, and spits on the ground. Joe K has managed not to get fired from his job despite his gross incompetence because he's blackmailing his boss. Joe K is a real prick.

One day, after a night of heavy drinking, the regulars in The Post decide to pool their money together and hire a hitman to take out Joe K. They gather around the ancient PC in the bar's back room, get on the Dark Web, and find the cheapest assassin they can. Armed with Joseph Kendall's name and description, the assassin descends on Boston.

On this particular day, there is a festival going on in the Boston Commons. To get to The Post, the assassin has to pass through the festival. While there, he wins a ring toss, and his prize is a giant stuffed camel. Pleased with his winnings, the hitman makes his way towards The Post. Unfortunately, our murderer-to-be is accosted by a drunk festival-goer, who wrests the camel from him, spits in his face, and scurried away. Understandably peeved, he continues on his less-than-merry way to The Post.

Once there, he pulls the closest patron to him, and demands to know where Joe is. The patron, drunk as a skunk, points him in the right direction. Taking out a bowie knife, he tackles the indicated Joseph to the ground and draws the knife sharply across his throat.

""You've done your last harm, Joseph Kendall"", whisperd the hitman.

Unfortunately, I'm sure you'll have realised his egregious error. The injured party was not Joe K, but Joseph Loggins, Joe L. Coughing up blood, Joe L spoke his final words;

""You fool"", he said. ""You've got the wrong Joe. I'm Joe L"".

He coughed again, and drew a ragged breath.

89,Red Car Day,"Red car day - in Honor of my Dad

My dad died 7 years ago. He was a worker in a factory in NYC during the by-gone, post-war era when times were good and jobs were plenty. The guys he worked with were all good friends over the years and enjoyed harmless pranks against one another to pass the time. This is one of his best stories which I told at his eulogy.

There was a new guy, Jim, who joined the crew the summer of ’74 who became an instant comrade. The jokesters of the crowd - my dad amongst them - decided after a month or 2 it was time for a prank.

It’s important to recall in those days there were no cell phones, computers, google, ezpass computerized toll collection, nothing. If you needed to go anywhere back then you needed physical directions “go a mile down the road and at the gas station make a left.” Even toll roads (bridges and such) had people manning them and if you dared speed through, there were dedicated patrol cars who would chase after you, get the toll and give you a ticket, right then and there.

They decided to invite him to the end of summer cookout traditionally given by Ben, one of the men at my dad’s job. Jim was told that Ben lived in a remote area where even a physical map wasn’t going to help nearing his house. 

“You’ve got to follow someone on the highway to get there because the exits get really tricky,” they told Jim. He asked my dad if he could follow him to the cookout. 

Dad: “Sure,” my dad said. “By the way, what color car do you have?” my dad asked rather matter of factly. 
Jim: “Well, red I guess. Why?” 
D: “You lucky SOB. The cookout is on the 19th, It’s red car day on the highway that day.”
J: “Red car day?! What the hell are you talking about?”
D: “What are you living under a rock? The highway has free toll days for red, black, yellow and blue cars on the 2nd, 14th, 19th and 22nd of every month during the summer.”
J: “I never heard of that. Why the hell do they do that?”
D: “When they were building this highway back in the 40s there were 4 deaths, and those 4 men are honored with free tolls on the days they died. 3 months out of the year they give people with red, black, yellow and blue cars (the color of the cars the men had) free tolls to honor the brave men who died building the very road you’re driving on.”
J: “Wow! That’s quite a story. I had no idea. I have to admit I don’t travel that road very but that is really very nice to honor them that way.”

So, Jim made arrangements to follow my dad (with me, my brother and mom in the car with him) on the 22nd of August. 

As we got onto the highway, my dad made sure to drive slow enough to not lose Jim and be absolutely certain Jim was right behind my dad as they approached the toll plaza. My dad rolled down the window to pay the toll saying to the clerk, “I’m paying for me and guy directly behind me.”

As my dad drive away slowly, Jim inched up not really sure what was going to happen. However, the toll booth clerk just waved her hand as if to say “go ahead” and Jim, a tad startled at first, hit the gas and went.

My dad giggled a bit, then made sure to keep driving slow enough to not lose Jim as they approached the second toll plaza. My dad said to the clerk, “This is for me and guy directly behind me.”

As my dad drive away slowly, you could see Jim was more confident but still cautious. However, as the toll booth clerk waved his hand “go ahead” Jim hit the gas, this time a smile crawling across his face. He gained up to my dad in no time.

The traffic was getting a bit thicker now and my dad used this traffic to partially lose Jim, but make sure he could still see him. Approaching the next toll plaza, my dad was in a different lane than Jim. My dad stopped and paid the toll while Jim sailed through the toll lane. You could hear the audible alarm of a toll-jumper, and the black-n-white police car in hot pursuit of Jim. 

My dad pulled away slowly from the toll catching up to Jim hearing him arguing with the cop, “Yeah, it’s red car day.”

The funniest part was hearing Jim tell his side of it at the BBQ. All the fellas chipped in to pay the fine.

The man tells the farmer about his situation and the farmer is sympathetic, allowing the man to stay the night. However, the farmer allows the man to stay the night under one condition, ""You gotta spend the night n' the barn. And don't put your peter in them knotholes.""

The man is puzzled, but grateful. 

After entering the barn, the man tries to go to sleep, but is incredibly uncomfortable sleeping in the barn. He tries everything, but just can't get to sleep. Finally, he decides to masturbate in an effort to help him sleep. 

While halfway through playing with himself, curiosity overwhelms him and he attempts to stick his 'peter' in the first knothole. 

It's clearly a vagina and it feels amazing. After a little while, enjoying himself, he sticks his peter in the second knothole. 

This one feels even better than the first. Close to climax, the man puts his peter in the third knothole. 

At this point, the farmer is woken up by the screams. 

After entering the barn, the farmer sees the man crying in the feudal position.

353,How the Canadians prepare their army,"A new recruit arrives on the front lines during world war 2. When he gets there he is told resources are stretched thin and they have not rifles to spare him, although they still expect him to go on patrol. He goes straight to his captain and explains the situation, the captain hands him a broom and tells him if he sees any germans to point the broom handle at them and shout ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" to kill them. The recruit thinks this is the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard but he has no choice so he agrees and heads out. While on patrol he comes across a German soldier. The German reaches for his rifle, so with no other option the recruit points his broom and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" and to his surprise the German drops dead. When he arrives back he immediately thanks the captain.

A couple of weeks went by and our guy had become quite the crackshot, even having a telescopic sight fixed to his broom. One day he was scouting the enemy position from under some bushes when he bumps into a German crawling the other way, in the cramped space he barely manages to point his broom at the German in time, so he returns to his captain and demands a weapon for close quarters combat. The captain takes a piece of string out of his drawer and tells him to hit an enemy with it and shout ""STAB STAB STABBITY STAB"". This time he trusts the captain and sure enough it works great.

Another couple of weeks go by and our guy is a legend. He kills dozens of Germans with his broom and string and receives several awards. One day while on patrol in a forest he sees a crazy German soldier in the distance running towards him and shouting at the top of his voice. He is pretty confident in his abilities, takes careful aim and shouts ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" but the German keeps on coming. He aims again ""BANG BANG BANGITY BANG"" and again nothing. The German is getting really close so he takes out his string, but as he swings it out and shouts ""STAB STAB STABBITY STAB"" the German just runs straight into him, knocking him clear off his feet into a tree and breaking several bones. As he lies there dying the German slows down and comes back for a look. He finds our hero lying crushed on the ground asking how this happened. He laughs, turns around and runs off, resuming his shouts of ""TANK TANK TANKITY TANK"".

3,So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.,"He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",Jokes,1570373961,Icy_Noob,5,58,True,2019-10-06

He asks the assistant “Do you have ‘European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2? I believe it was released this week.”
 

“Certainly,” replies the assistant. “Would you like to listen before you buy it?”


 ""That would be wonderful,"" says the expert, and puts on a pair of headphones.
 

He listens for a few moments and says to the assistant, “I'm terribly sorry, but I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and this is not accurate at all. I don't recognize any of those sounds. Are you sure this is the correct recording?”
 

The assistant checks the turntable, and replies that it is indeed European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2. The assistant apologizes and lifts the needle onto the next track.
 

Again the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant, ""No, this just can't be right! I've been an expert in this field for 43 years and I still don't recognize any of these sounds.""


 The assistant apologizes again and lifts the needle to the next track.
 

The expert throws off the headphones as soon as it starts playing and is fuming with rage. 

""This is outrageous false advertising! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and no European wasp has ever made a sound like the ones on this record!""


The manager of the shop overhears the commotion and walks over.


""What seems to be the problem, sir?""


""This is an outrage! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps. Nobody knows more about them than I do. There is no way in hell that the sounds on that record were made by European wasps!""

20,A store selling 'New Husbands',"A shop selling new husbands has been opened.

There women can go to find a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance are the following:

You can only visit this store ONCE! It is six floors and the value of the products increases as you come up the floors.

You can choose a product on one floor or you can choose to go up one floor.

But you can't walk down a floor, except to leave the store.

A woman enters the Husband's Shop to find herself a husband. On the first floor there is a sign on the door that says:

&amp;#x200B;

First Floor - These men have permanent jobs.

She is interested, but continues to the second floor where it says:

&amp;#x200B;

Second Floor - These men have a permanent job and love children.

""It's fine"" she thinks, ""but I want more"".

&amp;#x200B;

So she continues upwards. On the third floor it says on the sign:

Third Floor - These men have a permanent job, love children, and look extremely good.

""Shit,"" she thinks, but feels like she has to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign says:

Fourth Floor - These men have a permanent job, love children, look insanely good and help with the housework.

""Oh, God help me!"" she says, ""I can't stand it!""

But she still goes up another floor and the sign says:

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth Floor - These men have a permanent job, love children, look insanely good, help with the housework and are very romantic.

She is so tempted, but goes up to the sixth floor, where it says following on the sign:

&amp;#x200B;

6th floor - You are visitor number 31.456.012 on this floor.

There are no men on this floor. This floor exists only as evidence that it is impossible to satisfy women.

Thank you for visiting Husband's Store

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid being accused of gender discrimination, the shop owner has opened a ""New Wife Shop"" just opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

The first floor has wives who love sex.

&amp;#x200B;

The second floor has wives who love sex, have money and like beer

57,Two aliens landed in the New Mexico desert near a gas station that had been closed for the night.," 

They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger of the two aliens addressed it.

""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.""

The gas pump (of course) didn't respond.

The younger alien started to get mad at the lack of response and the older one said, ""I wouldn't do that if I were you.""

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated the greeting.

Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader, or I will fire.""

The older alien again warned his comrade, ""You don't want to do that. You really don't want to make him mad!""

""Rubbish,"" replied the younger alien.

He aimed his weapon at the pump and fired.

There was a huge explosion.

A massive fireball roared outwards and towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him in a burnt and crumpled mess 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Thirty-five Earth minutes later, when he finally regained consciousness, refocused his three eyes and straightened his bent antenna, he looked dazedly up at the wiser one, who was standing over him, slowly shaking his big green head.

""What a ferocious creature,"" said the young fried one. ""It damn near killed us! How did you know it was so dangerous?""

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler onto the crispy, peeling flesh and shared some knowledge.

""If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy,"" said the wise old alien. ""When a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick it in his ear, you don't mess with him.""",Jokes,1570379732,GreenBallJar,4,73,True,2019-10-06

Once upon a time there was a kingdom. This kingdom had a highly respected coat-of-arms flesh and blood animal, a golden-woolled sheep. One day this famous animal has walked away from the kingdom. Days have passed and the king haven't got any news from the whereabouts of the sheep. The king made an announcement, if someone finds the golden-woolled sheep then that person will get the half of the kingdom. But if someone gets home with empty hands then the person will hang. Two months have passed, hundreds have been hung the animal was still missing. The oldest son of the king had enough of this embarassing situation and told to the king that he is going to search the sheep next morning to restore the honor of the kingdom. The king appreciated the courage of the oldest son but warned the man what are the consequences of the search. The same rules are valid to him as well. Pointless searches result hanging, no exceptions. The oldest son went to the expedition, one month passed, he had no clue where is the sheep, had to go home. The king was really frustrated and sorrowful but a promise is a promise. The oldest son was hung. Months have passed after this tragic event and the sheep was still missing. The middle son of the king had enough of this embarassing situation and told to the king that he is going to search the sheep next morning to restore the honor of the kingdom and in memory of his brother. The king wanted to prevent this as he was affraid to lose another son. The middle kid was unstoppable, he went after the animal even so he know what are the consequences. Two months have passed, he had no clue where is the sheep, had to go home. He has been hung. The pain was indescribable for the king. Another months have passed, the animal was still missing. The youngest son of the king had enough of this embarassing situation and told to the king that he is going to search the sheep next morning to restore the honor of the kingdom and in memory of his brothers. The king locked him to his room to prevent the potential loss of his last son. The young kid was really stubborn. One night he managed to escape his room and went after the golden-woolled sheep. Three months have passed and he was not lucky. The animal was still missing. We all know what was the destiny of the youngest kid. As the animal disappeared without any clue the king gave up the whole search. He has stepped down, could not suffer more.

THE END.  
I know this is a sad and meaningless joke. Let me try to tell you another one, I hope you will like it more.

The train adventure

Once upon a time there was a man who went to a long trip with train. He got a seat  in a non-smoking cabin. He had a fellow traveler, a beautiful woman and her poodle. The train has not stopped since the departure. It was 3 hours ago. The man really wanted to smoke. He thought probably it won't be an issue as he always does that and his partners have always approved this. He almost lit the cigarette but the woman told him to stop as this is a non-smoking cabin and she hates the smoke. It was okay for the man, he thought that he can wait for the next stop. The train got to a tunnel. The departure was 5 hours ago and the conductor said that the next departure won't be there soon as the train will stop only at the terminus and it is 5 hours more to get there. The man thought now he waited a lot, he has to smoke. The urge is rising. He almost lit the cigarette but the woman told him to stop as this is still a non-smoking cabin and she hates the smoke. She threathened the man also if he lit a cigarette then she will throw it out throught the window and call the conductor. The man accepted this as he was the careless one and bought a ticket to a non-smoking cabin. An idea struck his mind. He realized that the woman has a poodle who had no muzzle. It was also against the rules. The man said that if the woman does something with his cigarette then he will throw the dog out through the window as it is against the rules. They have made a deal. The terminus was 2 hours away but the man could not hold his urge back. He had to smoke. If no, he will go crazy. So he lit the cigarette. The woman stood up and threw out the cigarette as she promised. The guy became really angry. He threw the dog out after the cigarette. They were so angry they could not talk to each other at that moment, just stared at the landscape through the windows. 10 minutes have passed and a surprising thing happened. They saw the dog who ran beside the train. What was in the dog's mouth?

NO. Not the cigarette. The golden-woolled sheep.

Startled, the man jumped back. He thought no one would believe him if he told them, and maybe the move was getting to his head, so he didn't tell anyone and went back to unpacking.

""REEEEEEE"" went the fence. The man jumped back in shock. Clearly he wasn't hallucinating. 

He tried many many times again and again, wondering what terrible secret lay on the other side. Who lived in that house that the fences were acting like this?

He eventually swallowed his pride and went and asked another neighbour. He invited the neighbour over and demonstrated. Sure enough, the fence screetched at him.

105,Going to Hell [Long],"The evil man arrived in Hell and was immediately greeted by his Eternal Assignment Demon. They walked down a dank hallway until they came upon a door. “This is your first option of three for you to serve your eternal damnation. Behold.” The EAD slides the hatch on the door and the evil man (let’s call him Jeff) peers in and sees a roomful of other sinners standing on their heads on the splintered, rotten, wooden floor. Jeff let’s out a laugh, “That’s so fucking stupid! Why in the hell would I want to do that forever? What else you got?”

The EAD leads Jeff further down the hallway and the come upon a second door. “Option #2 awaits you,” says EAD as he slides open the tiny window. Jeff looks in and sees basically the same thing—sinners standing on their heads, but in this room, the floor is crusty brick. Jeff snaps indignantly, “What the fuck? If I ain’t doing that on a wood floor, what makes you think I’d do it on bricks? Let’s go, you’re wasting my time.” EAD shrugs and tips his head to the side, pointing into the darkness down the hallway. 

They slog further until they finally come to the end of the hallway to the third door, facing them. “This is it. You gotta pick one.” EAD slides open the window and Jeff pushes him aside, anxious to see this final option. He is immediately slapped with an awful stench, and after wiping away his burning tears he sees a much larger group of sinners, every one smoking cigarettes and sloshing around kneed-deep in wet, steaming shit. Jeff launches into fury, but then catches himself and rubs his chin while he thinks for a minute. “Hmm, I love to smoke, I love it!, and I’m sure I’d eventually get used to that smell. Plus, I get to walk around!” “Yessir, I’ll take it!”

EAD calls over the guard to unlock the door, who then shoves Jeff into the room. He mingles with the crowd a bit and bums a smoke. He lights it and takes a long drag, when suddenly the hatch loudly slides open and the guard pokes his nasty face in, and hollers, “Break’s over!

236,A politician dies…,"And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  
  
“So, you’re a politician…” “Well, yes, is that a problem?” “Oh no, no problem. But we’ve recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you’re free to choose where you want to spend eternity!”  
  
“Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??” says the politician. “Them’s the rules” Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears… And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he’s in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds… Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can’t be right?  
  
“Open your eyes!” says a voice. “C'mon, wakey wakey, we’ve only got 24 hours!”. Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he’s in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite… And there’s a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. “Who are you??” The politician asks. “Well, I’m Satan!” says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. “Welcome to Hell!” “Wait, this is Hell? But… Where’s all the pain and suffering?” he asks. Satan throws him a wink. “Oh, we’ve been a bit mis-represented over the years, it’s a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there’s extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It’s a beautiful day, and if you’d care to look outside…” Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. “It’s one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there’s another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!” says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he’s admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he’s admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear… And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep… And is woken up by St Peter. “So, that was Hell. Wasn’t what you were expecting, I bet?” “No sir!” says the man. “So then” says St Peter “you can make your choice. It’s Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on”. “Well… I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I’d prefer Hell” says the politician. “Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!” Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  
  
The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. “What’s this??” He cries. “Where’s the hotel?? Where’s my wife??? Where’s the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???”

Next morning he felt a huge pain in his head, and saw a blue circle aroun his eyes. He asked his fater, if he knew anything about it. The fathet told him, that he hit the young boy in the face, because he got home drunk. After this, the boy was always paying attention to drink only in real moderation. 
At his 18th birthday, he went to his father and said: ""Dad, it is my 18th birthday party, I will drink, and most probably I will come home drunk, at least a bit. Can you please not beat me up this time?"". The father agreed to tolerate his drunk son that night.
The young man was grateful, and drank a lot with his friends, and they had a great time together.
The next morning, the young man felt some serious pain in his head, and found another blue patch on his face. He immediately went to his father, to question him about this. The father replied to the compliment: "" You know son, I was keeping my word, didn't say a word, when you came home drunk. I tolerated, that you called your sister bitch. Didn't say a word, when you tried to punch me. You broke your grandmother's favourite plate, and kicked a cat, I was silent.

His ribs shatter, his lungs collapse, and his now inert body is expanded into the shape of the bar.  

The bar is for almost entirely engulfed before the man's delicate skin gives way to the immense pressure...with a noisy explosion of blood and organs, the tattered remains of what was once a man were spewed around the parking-lot where the bar previously stood.  

The bar, now soaked in a horrendous combination of blood and organ fluid, reflects upon the failure of its experiment. For its next attempt, a man of far greater fortitude must be used, so that his body does not splatter away so effortlessly.

He decides to start his own subreddit for absolutely, 100%, completely original material.  To kick things off, he opens his new sub with a contest to see who can come up with the funniest, most absolutely original joke.  Post after post pour in, but he notices in each one how a punchline was stolen from here or how the joke was just rehashed from there.  Frustrated, he is about to give up, when he notices a joke - a truly fresh joke - that appears to be OC.  And it's *funny.*  After chuckling about it for a while, the man posts, ""Surprise!

310,The man who loved fishing,"A husband is fanatical about fishing.

Twice a month on the weekend, he heads out for the lake early and spends most of the day.

He does this come rain or shine.

One Saturday morning he gets up early, dresses quietly, gets his lunch made, puts on his long johns, grabs the dog and goes to the garage to hook up his boat to the truck and down the driveway he goes.

Coming out of his garage rain it is still dark and the rain is pouring down; it is like a torrential downpour.

There is snow mixed in with the rain, and the wind is blowing 50mph.

He makes a go of it, but the weather worsens the further he drives.

Finally, his common sense outdoes his desire to fish, and reluctantly, he turns around. 30 minutes later, he has made it back to his driveway.

He goes into the house and quietly turns on the TV to the weather channel.

He finds it’s going to be bad weather all day long, so he puts his boat back in the garage, quietly undresses and slips back into bed.

There he cuddles up to his wife’s back, now with a different anticipation.

He reaches around and cups one breast in his hand. Snuggling up to her neck, he whispers,

“The weather out there is terrible.”

To which she sleepily replies,

403,In 1952 the New York Philharmonic was on a national tour...,"...and on their way home from the west coast when their flight was grounded in Kansas due to bad weather.

It had been a long tour and tensions had been running high. A first violin player was a wreck from excessive alcohol consumption, the trumpet section engaged in much infighting due to competing egos, and the timpani player showed up late to many performances.

Donovan Schmidt, the leader of the orchestra at the time and renowned for his bad temper, was furious. The flight delay was the last straw and his patience was starting to get the better of him.

After enduring a 30 minute argument between his bassoon and tuba players, Schmidt snapped and threw his baton at them. 

Sailing through the air the baton pierced a bassoon player's eye, entered his brain, and he promptly dropped dead.

The ensuing months saw Schmidt dragged in and out of court and the nation waited with baited breath to see what would become of his fate.

Finally, it was ruled by a jury of his peers that he should face the death penalty by electric chair. Shocked and dismayed, the arts community rallied around Schidmt, but it was to no avail. The date had been set.

Strapped into the chair and with his head shaven, Schmidt had tears streaming down his face as the warden gave the nod to throw the switch....then, nothing happened. 

Confused, the death row technicians reset the machine, rewired the harness and waited for the Warden's signal....then, nothing.

This happened 4 times in a row, until the warden screamed at his officers ""just what in the hell is going on in there!""

Scratching his head, the senior corrections officer yells out to the warden ""I dunno...I guess he must be a bad conductor.""",Jokes,1570421636,nauticaltiger,0,15,True,2019-10-07

The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation in which you will have to make a decision. Only you will know the results, so remember that your answer needs to be honest.

THE SITUATION:

You are in Florida, Miami to be specific.

There is chaos all around you caused by a hurricane with severe flooding. This is a flood of biblical proportions. You are a photojournalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.

You're trying to shoot career-making photos.

There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water.

THE TEST:

Suddenly you see a man in the water. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken down with the debris. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar. You suddenly realize who it is.

It's Donald Trump! At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever.

YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS:

You can save the life of Donald Trump or you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize winning photo, documenting the death of one of the most powerful Republicans in America.

THE QUESTION:

Here's the question, and please give an honest answer. ""Would you select high contrast color film, or would you go with the classic simplicity of black and white?""",Jokes,1570442051,Ciseak,24,29,True,2019-10-07

74,[NSFW] A business man was robbed in Las Vegas on his way to the airport,"After he had checked out of the hotel late at night, 2 muggers have robbed his purse, mo and notebook, leaving him behind with his luggage. 

He had hours left to get to the airport, and he was lucky that his ticket was at the side compartment of his luggage. He walked up to the street to the single standing taxi he could find. He approached the car and then knocked at the window. 

The cab driver rolled down his windows and asked: ""Let me guess, airport? Makes 60 dollars.""

The business man replied: ""I have no cash with me, I was robbed. No cash, no credit cards, but I've got my ticket with me.""

With shaking head the driver huffs: ""No cash, no business with me.""

Desperated, the business man pleas for good faith in the driver: ""Please, you gotta help me, I've got 4 hours left, and I promise to pay you. I will double the fare. And add 100 dollars on top! I'm pleading with you, please take me to the airport!""

The driver lets his offer sink in for a minute, then says: ""Your offer stinks. I don't want to trust you. Take a bus or something."" and drove off, leaving the business man behind. 

However, the business man was lucky and able to catch his flight, even though he made it in last minute. 

A year later again the business man has a trip in Las Vegas. Upon finishing his trip, he checks out of the hotel and walks to a taxi stand, where all taxis are lined one after the another. Near the rear end the business man recognizes the taxi driver who had left him alone in times of dire need. 

The business man then goes to the front end pf the parked row and asked the cab driver: ""How much is it to the airport?""

Driver: ""60 dollars!""

Man: ""And how much do you take for a blow job?""

Driver: ""Fuck off!"" and rolled up his window 

The business man goes to the next driver behind and asks the same questions, only to get told to ""fuck off"" every time. He repeats it with every other vab driver, until he approaches the last year's cab driver. While approaching, the driver doesn't recognize the business man from last year.

The business man knocked at the window and the cab driver rolled down the window and asked: ""Let me guess, airport? Makes 60 dollars!"".

The business man answered: ""That's a nice offer! I'll take that!"" and gets in.

108,"An ex-businessman, now bankrupt, is preparing to jump off a bridge...","As he's about to step into the void, a hand grabs him from behind.

He turns back annoyed and sees that the hand belongs to an old bearded overweight guy.

""Why did you stop me you old fool?""

""Have you gone mad my son? You were about to kill yourself!"" The old man exclaims with a booming voice.

""I have nothing to live for anymore! Just let me end it!""

""Listen my son. I'm Santa Claus and I'm just here on vacation. But if you'd like, tell me what the problem is and maybe we can fix it."" Said the old man with genuine concern.

""OK Santa, I'll tell you"" the businessman shrugged ""I used to be a really successful businessman. I had it all, amazing cars, beautiful women, loads of money. But now I lost it all thanks to the stock market crash. So I have nothing to live for.""

""That's what got you in such melancholy? My boy, my boy! Tomorrow morning at 10, come here on this bridge and there will be a brand new Lamborghini waiting just for you!""

The businessman is surprised, then ecstatic. He grabs Santa and kisses him on both cheeks and then starts crying with joy. They sit down and talk for a while. But when they start discussing women, the businessman is depressed again.

""Oh Santa, I used to be such a playboy. Every single night I would bring home at least 2 different stunning and beautiful girls. Now, and at my age, I'll be lucky to find a mediocre girlfriend.""

""That's what got you worried? Don't pout my son. In the Lamborghini tomorrow there will be 4 beautiful women waiting for you. They are all yours!""

The man starts hugging Santa again and says

""I'm sorry Santa, maybe it's too much, but since you are doing all this for me, could you give me back at least part of my wealth? I wasn't a greedy asshole like the rest of them. I used to spend it left and right and give to charities. I just enjoyed making people happy, and I'd like that back again.""

""Sure my boy. One of the women tomorrow will have a suitcase with 1 billion dollars in it. It's all yours!""

""Oh thank you Santa, thank you so much. How could I ever repay you?""

""Well, there's one thing... I kinda miss my wife who had to stay at the North Pole, and especially... well this is embarassing... her blowjobs that she gave me every night. Would you give me a blowjob?""

The businessman is dumbfounded at first, but quickly steels himself

""Santa, you didn't just save my life, you gave it back to me as well. What you ask is the least I can do and I will gladly do it!""

""Brilliant my boy. My hotel isn't far from here. Follow me.""

Santa leads the businessman to a hotel a couple blocks away. They go into Santa's bedroom and the businessman drops to his knees, unbuckles Santa's pants and goes to work. After they finish up, the business man goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Santa leans at the door and asks:

""My boy, you never told me your name""

""I'm Alex, Santa""

""Nice to meet you Alex. Tell me, how old are you?""

""It's simple,"" said the hiring manager.  ""You go door-to-door selling toothbrushes.  Everyone needs a toothbrush, you should be able to sell lots of them.""

The man agreed, and went out to a large housing tract for the day.  When he returned to the office he was asked how his day went.

""I sold one toothbrush,"" he said.

The hiring manager was not happy.  ""Look, I know it's your first day in sales, so I'll forgive it this time.  But you gotta sell more than one if you want to keep your job.""

The next day the man went to another neighborhood.  When he returned to the office at the end of the day he said, ""I sold two toothbrushes today!""

Now the hiring manager was furious.  ""That's not nearly enough!  You have one more day to get this right.  If you don't sell a lot more tomorrow, you're fired.""

When the man came back to the office at the end of the next day, again he was asked how he did.  ""I sold 1500 toothbrushes!"" he proclaimed.

""Oh my god!"" said the hiring manager.  ""That's incredible.  It's more than anyone has ever sold in one day before.  How did you do it?""

""Well,"" he began, ""I went to a grocery store and set up a table outside with some chips and some dip.  And I asked people to try them.  They would taste it and say, 'This dip tastes like shit!'

156,Devil and God,"The one true God and the last incarnation of the Devil were having a cup of tea and talking about the end of evolution.

God: Wisest soul, youngest heart. Did you foresee this ending?

Devil: Oldest soul, smartest spirit. I can honestly say I did not. You tempted them to the path of love and I, the path of evil. I honestly thought one of us would win. How did we both end up losing?

God: The numbers were horrifying. After seeing all those zeroes I was absolutely certain that Hell would over power Heaven by getting everyone addicted, but, during the final days of the end of evolution it became clear that things would be decided by the last vote. The legendary words uttered by the biblical atheist brought doom upon us just as nature prophesied.

Devil: Say old friend, could you say his words for me in your voice. I want to hear it from you. I'll let you have a date with Hell herself for entertaining me.

God: I would rather you sing me a song.

Devil: Done.

After taking a moment to contain his hysterical laughter that would have taken him exactly one eternity to calm down, God looked Devil in the eyes and spoke the words of the last human who was given the choice every human before him was offered: 'Eternal grace or endless style'. God spoke in his voice of endless harmony.

God: ""So, you're asking me if I want to be Ultra Holy Saint or a Psychosociopath. Would a lion eat grass? It would not. Would a deer eat meat? It would not. There is absolutely one thing a human cannot do. A human cannot accept defeat. This is clearly a game between two. Neither of these options have humanity in them. I forfeit my vote.""

Devil stopped his heart for a moment before having an epiphany. 

Devil: I just thought of a joke.

God: Pray, do tell.

Devil: Man asked woman: ""What am I without you?""

She said: ""A cigarette without a lighter to light it.""

He laughed and asked: ""Then tell me what are you without me?""

She said: ""A lighter that has nothing to burn.""

God: That was a terrible joke, dear friend.

Devil: You didn't get it.

God: Pray, do explain.

Devil: A ciggarette can be lit by a match stick and the purpose of a lighter is not burning things. Its purpose is to create a flame.

God: The point?

His wife is annoyed and is constantly telling him to go the doctor, but the man kept refusing.

One day during an argument, his wife has had it with his coughing and hacking and tells him ""Im making a bet, if this damn coughin kills you i'm writing ' I told you so' on your tombstone!""  
The man laughs her off since they both have a twisted sense of humor, and tells her its a deal, if the coughin kills him she can carve that.  
The man continues on for another week

One day the man is out going for a walk through his neighborhood, when a freak accident occurs between a truck carrying coffins and a car, which results in a coffin flying off the truck, tragically landing on the old man and crushes him.

Later at his funeral, his wife makes a very odd request to have them carve ""I told you so"" on his headstone.

When the caretaker asks her why she wants to do this, she tells him about their dark humor, and fills him in on the bet they recently made.  
The caretaker is touched by the story, and agrees to do it for her, because in the end,

“Pretty much the way you do,” responded the Martian.
Discussion ensues and finally the couples decide to swap partners for the night and experience one another. The female Earthling and the male Martian go off to a bedroom where the Martian strips. He’s got only a teeny, weeny member; very short and very narrow.

“What can you do with THAT!?” exclaims the woman.

“Why?” he asked, “What’s the matter?”

“Well,” she replied, “it’s nowhere near long enough. It’ll never reach!”

“No problem,” he said and proceeded to slap his forehead with his palm. With each slap of his forehead, his member grew until it was quite impressively long.

“Well,” she said. “That’s quite impressive, but it’s still pretty narrow.”

“No problem,” he said again and started pulling his ears. With each pull his member grew wider and wider until the entire measurement was extremely exciting to the woman.

“Wow!” she exclaimed as they fell into bed and made mad, passionate love.

The next day the couples rejoined their normal partners and went off together.
