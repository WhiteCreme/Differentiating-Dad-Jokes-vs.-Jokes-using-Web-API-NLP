279,Donald Davis,"Donald Davis loved his job. He was a bus driver for a cross county bus service and it meant he saw lots of new places each and every week. He loved it so much that he always took up any opportunity for overtime. His friends all thought him mad, and gave him the nickname DooDa which matched his eccentric bus obsession as much as his name.

His wife didn't feel the same way. She loves Donald very much but felt she would always come second to buses. She decided that when he next comes home from his latest trip she would tell him it was her or the buses.

Unfortunately, during this trip, Donald crashed and died instantly. The police didn't find any ID so phoned the bus depot to confirm the death, and when asked if one of his friends could inform his wife before the police got there to prepare her, they dutifully agreed.

""Gary, you've been Donald's best friend for 25 years, you were his best man at his wedding, are you able to tell his wife? It would be best if it came from you."" Asked the depot manager.

Gary solemnly agreed and headed out to Donald's house to break the news.

When he knocked the door his wife answered almost instantly and could see the dread on Gary's face. Struggling to think of what to say, he blurted out;

Ms. Wack froze for a second, then...

""THE Keith Richards?""
""Oh, yes. In fact, he told me he's friends with your manager, which is why I came in here.""
""Okay... Do you have any collateral?""
""Excuse me?""
""Collateral. Something of value, like a car, or a boat...""
""Oh, yes! I do have something. I have this.""

Kermit reached into his briefcase and placed a small figurine on the desk. Patricia looked curiously at the object, then at our amphibious friend.

""What's this?""
""It's a Hummel.""
""A what?""
""A Hummel. They're supposed to be quite valuable. Well, at least this one is to me.""

She picked up the Hummel and stood up.

""If you don't mind, I would like to show this to the manager.""
""Oh, no! I don't mind at all!""

So, Patricia took the Hummel to the manager's office, knocked on the door, and walked inside.

""Patricia! What can I do for you?""
""Mr. Wilson, there's this... frog named Kermit at my desk, and he wants to borrow $10,000, but he has only this for collateral.""

Mr. Wilson looked at the Hummel, then out to her desk.

415,Funny quotes from Blackadder the Third,"Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): I have come up with a plan so cunning you could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel.

&amp;#x200B;

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): Morning, Mr. B.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Leave me alone, Baldrick. If I wanted to talk to a vegetable, I would have bought one at the market.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Referring to a suicide pill they have both been given, after being captured by French revolutionaries\]

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): I‚Äôm glad to say you won‚Äôt be needing that pill, Mr. B.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Am I jumping the gun, Baldrick, or are the words ‚ÄúI have a cunning plan‚Äù marching with ill-deserved confidence in the direction of this conversation?

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): They certainly are.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Well, forgive me if I don‚Äôt do a cartwheel of joy; your record in this department is hardly 100%. So what is it?

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): We do nothing ‚Ä¶

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Yup, it‚Äôs another world-beater.

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): No, wait. We do nothing ‚Ä¶ until our heads have actually been cut off.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): And then we ‚Ä¶ spring into action?

&amp;#x200B;

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): \[to Baldrick\] Unless I think of something, tomorrow we go to meet our Maker: in my case God, in your case God knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): Sounds like a bag of grapefruits to me, Mr B.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): The phrase, Baldrick, is ‚Äúa case of sour grapes‚Äù ‚Äì and yes it bloody well is.

&amp;#x200B;

Mrs. Miggins: The Scarlet Pimpernel, Mr. Blackadder! He‚Äôs so exciting, don‚Äôt you think?

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Actually, I think he‚Äôs the most over-rated human being since Judas Iscariot won the AD31 Best Disciple Competition.
