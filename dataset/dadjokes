491,"There's an onion, and he's studying law at a prestigious college. He's in his third year, and after a particularly tough day, he gets an invite from one of his onion-friends to a party they're having that evening.","Being tired and weary, the lawyer-onion isn't sure whether to go, but decides he needs cheering up. 

So he dresses smartly, puts on his favorite aftershave and heads over to his friend's.

He gets to the party to find it quite a packed affair and heads over to the bar - fighting through crowds of reveller-onions - to get a drink.

 As he gets to the bar, he notices in one corner a slightly out-of-place female onion. 

She looks a bit sad and being the compassionate onion that he is, he heads over to talk to her.

This is quickly affirmed as a good move, as they hit it off immediately; she was abandoned by her friends shortly after arriving and had been minding her own business ever since, but over a night of drinks and talking, they quickly fall into an infatuation and soon end up spending an oniony night of passion together.

When they awake in the morning, they don't find it awkward and a steady relationship between the two is struck. 
 
 This lasts a good while, having its ups and downs like any college relationship, but eventually the day comes when they both graduate. 

The two couldn't be happier! 

They both get jobs close to one another and move into an apartment together.

One day, the partner-onion is anxiously awaiting the lawyer-onion at home. 

She's been ill all day and checking has confirmed her suspicions.

 She tearfully - and joyfully - breaks the news to the lawyer-onion; they're going to have a tiny baby-onion together.  

A shallot, if you will. 

A few days later, this prompts the lawyer-onion to propose to his heretofore girlfriend-onion.

 They are soon wed, having a fantastic wedding-day and husband and wife-onions are on top of the world.

The day comes of the birth and no complications - a tiny, healthy baby onion is born to two proud parents. 

Seeing this little bundle of oniony love in their arms causes them to fall deeper in love than ever.

Over the next few years, husband-and-wife-onions' lives are fantastic. 

He's prospering at work, she's really enjoying taking some time to raise the baby-onion and over time the baby-onion grows into a hale and hearty toddler-onion, who then becomes a child-onion.

One day, the idyll of the onions' lives is shattered when tragedy strikes.

The lawyer-onion (now a partner-onion in a prestigious law firm due to chance and hard work) is at work, and mother-onion is washing dishes and watching her child play in the yard. 

She glances away to take another plate and turns her vision back to the yard just in time to see her child wander into the adjacent road and get hit by a massive truck.

She screams, runs out and calls an ambulance.


The ambulance comes and rushes the frail child-onion to the Onion Hospital.

 Being in such a critical condition, he is rushed straight into the ER and mommy-and-daddy onion can do little but wait outside hoping for some news.


After an agonising five-hour wait, the weary-looking doctor-onion emerges in surgical garb, ready to impart news.

""So, Mr and Mrs Onion. Would you like the good news or the bad news?""

The couple ponder it for a moment, and then decide, ""The good news, please.""

The doctor-onion regards them briefly and then says, ""Well, the good news is we've managed to stabilise your child. The bad news is... he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of his life.""",dadjokes,1570269998,honolulu_oahu_mod,8,64,True,2019-10-05

221,Elon musk was revving his way merrily down the street on his 1000cc sportbike at a moderate pace of 50 MPH.,"Approaching in the opposite lane was Elon's chiropractor and a prank expert in their Tesla automobile, both playing Last Shelter: Survival on their mobile phones. When the chiropractor -- who was driving -- pointed Elon out to his companion, the prank expert, the latter took a firm grip on the Tesla's steering wheel and swerved directly into Musk's path. Elon braked suddenly on his motorcycle, and steered onto the pavement to avoid being pranked by the two Last Shelter: Survival-playing-fiends and their Tesla. As Elon hit the gutter and the curb, his hands were jolted free of the handlebars, his feet jolted free of the footpegs, and a small excrement jolted free from his loose rectum. Elon's fast trajectory continued sideways into one of Tesla's main shareholders, who leapt aside and shook Elon's hand vigorously as he flew past him , the shock of which released another morcel from Elon's panic-loosened bootyhole. It was when Elon did a shoulder check and noticed that The two Fiends in the Tesla were now following him down the pavement, mowing down pedestrians and playing Last Shelter: Survival on their way, that the third turd emerged from his now empty and useless rectum. ""Oh Shit"" Elon cursed miserably to himself as he was rear-ended by the two fiends, and his bottom smashed through the windscreen of the Tesla, his pants ripping to shreds in the process. The prank expert, who turned out to be French, exclaimed ""C'etait vraiment une epic prank qu'on vous a fait, Monsieur Musk!"" as he and the chiropractor spanked Elon's naked bottom with their mobile phones.

The customer quickly bought three. A week later, he was back in the  store complaining that the fish heads were disgusting and he wasn‚Äôt any  smarter.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt eat enough,‚Äù replied the store owner, and the customer  went home with 20 more fish heads. Two weeks later, he was back and this  time he was really angry.
